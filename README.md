# PROS-Brake-Mode
Simple Project to test the different brake modes of the V5 motor in this project.

See how `BRAKE_HOLD`, `BRAKE_BRAKE`, and `BRAKE_COAST` with different motor movement methods like
`move_voltage()` `move_velocity()` and `move_relative()`


**Note**: Only Compatible with PROS, and the latest kernel version of 3.2.0



**How to use it?**
Upload and run the project on your V5 Brain. Follow the instructions on the LCD.
Would advise to just run this demo, on a motor that is not suspetible to damaging (lift or angler for example)



**How to Install it?**
You can either install and clone it into it's own separate project, or install it and apply it as a template in your project.


**Installing as separate project**:
Install the repositiory as a zip and open it up as a project in the PROS Editor/CLI

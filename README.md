# PROS-Brake-Mode

Simple Project to test the different brake modes of the V5 motor in this project.

See how `BRAKE_HOLD`, `BRAKE_BRAKE`, and `BRAKE_COAST`work with different motor movement methods like
`move_voltage()` `move_velocity()` and `move_relative()`

**Note**: Only Compatible with PROS, and the latest kernel version of 3.2.0

**How to use it?**
Upload and run the project on your V5 Brain. Follow the instructions on the LCD.
Would advise to just run this demo on a motor that is not susceptible to damage (i.e. a lift motor may not be the best idea to test this program on)

**How to Install it?**
You can either install and clone it into it's own separate project, or install it and apply it as a template in your project.
